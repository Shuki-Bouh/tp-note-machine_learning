    "# Context & Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This TP aims to familiarize yourself with the \"universal workflow of machine learning\" (this expression is from Chollet et al. (2019) ). This workflow should be used as a step-by-step guideline to reach preliminary results on a new machine learning project. It is composed of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Problem definition** : define the machine learning task based on available data, visualize and compute summary statistics on your data to better understand them ;\n",
    "2.   **Dataset preparation** : perform some feature engineering if needed (such as variable selection), format your data in a way that can be fed into a machine-learning model, i.e. as a feature matrix or tensor **X**, and build a vector of labels *y* for supervised tasks, perform feature normalization and selection if needed (done in conjunction with step 3) ;\n",
    "3.   **Evaluation protocol** : split **X** into a train / test partition (we remind you that the goal of this splitting is first to train a classifier by \"fitting\" it on the training subset, and secondly to make this trained classifier predict unseen digits from the test subset), choose performance metrics, define a cross-validation procedure, evaluate a baseline machine learning model (starting with off-the-shelf algorithms adapted to your problem and default model parameters) ;\n",
    "\n",
    "4.   **Model evaluation** : run model training and test w.r.t the evaluation protocol, interpret performance result and re-iterate the worflow from step 2 as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this TP, we will see how this workflow can be used to achieve first results  towards the development of these two (already existing) industrial products:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   The [CheckReaderâ„¢](https://www.a2ia.com/en/a2ia-checkreader-0) system from the company Mitek : it is a global standard for advanced image analysis and intelligent recognition software used to seamlessly, precisely and securely process checks and other payment documentation by banks, financial institutions and other progressive corporations around the world. Here we will focus on the **recognition of handwritten digits from bank checks** ;\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   (BONUS part) The [Faradai Platform](https://faradai.ai/?page=blog&subpage=forecasting-energy-consumption-with-ai) develops SaaS products for energy management. It has various modules to analyze energy usage or energy production ; **Energy Consumption Forecasting** is one of these tools. Forecasting is crucial for energy managers to track the success of energy conservation projects and to calculate the feasibility of energy saving investments. It is also important for energy budget managers to prepare highly accurate budgets for the next quarter or year and to procure cost-effective energy tariffs."

    "**Question 2.1** : for this project, we will be using the [opsd_germany_daily](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenfly/opsd/master/opsd_germany_daily.csv) dataset. You can download it using its url and the [pandas.read_csv()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) method from the `pandas` library.\n",
    "As you should see your dataset has been put into a pandas `DataFrame`. The library `pandas` provides a set of open source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. `pandas` tools are widely used in data sciences, especially with time series data. So before going further, you will have to get more familiar with `pandas`, take 10 mins to go through the official [tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html).\n",
